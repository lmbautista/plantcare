      instructions:
        title: Setup your plantcare
        subtitle: Here you could find further details about how to configure step by step your board
        step-1:
          title: Request your prototype
          description: |
            Now you got an existing account, the first step is to contact the Author <b>(%{link})</b>
            to get your prototype. Once you got it you could jump into the next step
        step-2:
          title: Register a new plantcare
          description: |
            The prototype will have a sticker with the IDs of the wet sensor and the water pump.
            Those IDs will be needed to register %{link} your Plantcare.
        step-3:
          title: Place the physical devices
          description: |
            Here are the resources to place:
            <ul class="pl-4">
            <li>
              The prototype: as it's charged by the sun, <b><i>we recommended placing it outside</i></b>.
              If not, you can also plug it into any common electric outlet via USB micro
            </li>
            <li>The wet sensor: place it near to the trunk and the watered zones</li>
            <li>The water pump: place it in a water tank</li>
            </ul>
        step-4:
          title: Plantcare ready
          description: |
            Once you placed all the devices, you'll start receiving fresh information from your plantcare's status
            (ensure the board is synced with your account with the wifi icon of the plantcare's card).
