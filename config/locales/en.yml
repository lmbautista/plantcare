          description: |
            <p>Plantcare is a physical device that includes WIFI connectivity. It will allow you
            to schedule either seasonal or punctual irrigation remotelly through our app.</p>
            <p>It has periodic communication to perform waterings and send information about the status of your plant,
            so you could check anytime/anywhere what your plant needs.</p>
            <p>From now on you won't need to delegate the irrigation of your plant to other people. You'll have full control
            over your plants everytime you need</p>
        feature-2:
          title: Self-sustainable & ECO system
          description: |
            <p>Plantcare is built with biodegradable plastics. Also, a solar versi√≥n is available.

            <p>Your Plantcare will be alive for ever</p>
        feature-3:
          title: Long-life duration system
          description: |
            <p>Even if the solar panel on your Plantcare is not an option, our board is designed to be

        step-1:
          title: Register your plant
          description: |
            Now you have an existing account and a Plantcare board, let's register your plant in the application.
            Take note of the authentication token provided and the WIFI credentials where you will connect your board.
        step-2:
          title: Configure your board
          description: |
            <p>Place the Plantcare board within the pot and turn it on.</p>
            <p><b><i>Pot should be as dried as usually you have it, so the calibration process could calculate the humidity thresholds</i></b>.></p>
            <p>The board will start the <b>Configuration mode</b> blinking a blue light:
              <ul class="pl-3 pt-2">
                <li class="pb-1">Access the board WIFI connection via mobile (network name like <i>plantcare-sdpoiw9e</li>
                <li class="pb-1">Access the configuration portal through your browser at the address <code>192.168.1.4</code></li>
                <li class="pb-1">Set your authentication token and the WIFI credentials and submit the form</li>
                <li class="pb-1">If credentials are valid, the board will get into <b>Calibration mode</b></li>
                <li>If not, you'll stay in <b>Configuration mode</b> to introduce the right credentials
              </ul>
            </p>
        step-3:
          title: Calibrate your board
          description: |
            <p>The board will start the <b>Calibration mode</b> turning on a purple light.</p>
            <p>For 1:30 minutes, your device will take humidity sensor measurements. Follow these steps to perform a proper calibration:</p>
            <ul class="pl-3 pt-2">
              <li class="pb-1">Let the board to get some measurements during 15 seconds</li>
              <li class="pb-1">Then, let's irrigate manually your plant (ensure you irrigate the zone where the board was placed)</li>
              <li>Once the calibration is done, the board will start the <b>Online mode</b></li>
            </ul>
        step-4:
          title: Plantcare ready
          description: |
            <p>Congratulations! Now the board will start the <b>Online mode</b> turning on a white light.</p>
            <p>From now on your board will have periodically communication with the application to track the soil moisture of your pot
            and watering it when needed</p>
